# Task for Frontend Intern position at Profil Software

This solution is far from good - the state doesn't update properly for each form. It is an easy fix but requires some extra time. I also didn't include the persistence. 
I hope this partial solution will be sufficient to show my thought process and I will try to improve the project in Monday.
